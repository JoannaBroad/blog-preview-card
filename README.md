## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Info

This project was created with HTML Sass and me :)
as well as using the design files i added a little of myself in by animating the changes such as the box shadow and colour change when hovered over making the change seem a little smoother and less jarring.
